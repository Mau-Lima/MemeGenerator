# MemeGenerator
Picks a random meme template from a folder and fills it up with random pictures from another folder.

A really quick and tiny program which always does this:
1. Pick a random template from the templates folder
2. Find all empty white (or almost-white because of JPEG compression) boxes
3. Put a picture from the pictures folder on each box
4. Done
